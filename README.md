# TAG - Text Adventure Game

Yeah, I know, really creative name. This is an old program I worked on for a while when I was first starting out, it's just a basic text baseed adventure game, no graphics.
It was very much a work in progress when I stopped working on it years ago and recently decided I wanted to brush off my very dusty C++ coding skills.
What better way to do that than with an old program? I plan to work on this more when I get a chance
